Team Members: Jorge Torres, Nicole Nanton, Clinton Waters, Kasa Ftwi, Nell Meier

# Project Description
We will be pulling data from Yelps API to examine the coorelation between available foods and the most popular foods collect through user data. We would like to take a look at multiple questions (defined below) to try and determine which cuisine is really leading the nation.  Since we are likely not able to see data on specific user groups or demographics and their preferences, we are going to take a look at more of a high level overview of popular categories that users would deem important when choosing their next dining option or restaurant endevor.  We are choosing to keep the scope of the project limited to the top 20 cuisines and the top 50 options in each state's capital.  

# Research Questions to Answer

* Who has the biggest market share?
* Who has the city/state has the most options?
* Who has the greatest denisty of a specific cuisine?
* Who has the most chain restaurants?
* What are the top 7/ bottom 7 cities in restaurant choices?
* Who has the biggest offering per genre?
* How to ratings coorelate to restaurant volume? 
* Who has the best ratings?

# Rough Breakdown of Tasks

The first task we will need to complete is sourcing the data and looking to see if we can pull sufficient data to answer our questions above, and refine to fit the questions we are asking.  We will also need to identify the most appropriate way to visualize our data, and take steps to clean and scrub specific data to fit these visualizations. We will then analyze our findings and summarize and conclude our findings using statistical analysis and communicate our findings to be clearly understood by our peers in our presentation.
