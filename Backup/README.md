Project 1
Netflix Vs. Hulu: Who is the Biggest Player?

Team Members: Jorge Torres, Nicole Nanton, Clinton Waters, Kasa Ftwi, Nell Meier
Project Description
We will be pulling data from Netflix and Hulu Pypi’s to examine the relationship between two popular streaming services.  We would like to take a look at multiple questions (defined below) to try and determine which streaming service is superior, in multiple senses of the word.  Since we are likely not able to see data on specific user groups or demographics and their preferences/ watch patterns, we are going to take a look at more of a high level overview of popular categories that users would deem important when choosing their preferred streaming service.  We are choosing to keep the scope of the project limited to Netflix and Hulu, the two most recognized and diverse streaming services.  As we examine what else the pypi’s include, we will refine our limitations and scope, since Netflix and Hulu do not have their own API’s available to the public.
Research Questions to Answer
Between Netflix and Hulu, we would like to find the answers to the following questions (to start):
Who has the biggest subscriber base?
Who has the biggest offering?
Who has the biggest offering of movies vs. tv shows?
Who has the most original content?
What are the top 10 titles?
Who has the biggest offering per genre?
What are the top 10 titles by year?
Who has the best ratings?
Who has the largest number of views?
	
Datasets to be used
We will be using the Netflix and Hulu pypi, since neither screening service offers their own API.  Please see links below:

Rough Breakdown of Tasks
The first task we will need to complete is sourcing the data and looking to see if we can pull sufficient data to answer our questions above, and refine to fit the questions we are asking.  We will also need to identify the most appropriate way to visualize our data, and take steps to clean and scrub specific data to fit these visualizations. We will then analyze our findings and summarize and conclude our findings using statistical analysis and communicate our findings to be clearly understood by our peers in our presentation.
